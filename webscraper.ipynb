After his early release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking theTreaty of Versaillesand promotingpan-Germanism,antisemitism, andanti-communismwithcharismaticoratory andNazi propaganda. He frequently denouncedcommunismas being part of aninternational Jewish conspiracy. By November 1932, the Nazi Party held the most seats in theReichstag, but not a majority. Former chancellorFranz von Papenand other conservative leaders convinced PresidentPaul von Hindenburgto appoint Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933.

He directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, causing Britain and France todeclare war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler orderedan invasion of the Soviet Union. In December 1941, hedeclared war on the United States. By the end of 1941, German forces and the EuropeanAxis powersoccupied most of Europe andNorth Africa. These gains were gradually reversed after 1941, and in 1945 theAllied armiesdefeated the German army. On 29 April 1945, he married his longtime partner,Eva Braun, in theFührerbunkerin Berlin.

His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the  Great Depression , the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, which initially gave him significant popular support. One of Hitler's key goals was  Lebensraum  ( lit.   ' living space ' ) for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive,  expansionist  foreign policy is considered the primary  cause of World War II in Europe . He directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, causing Britain and France to  declare war on Germany . In June 1941, Hitler ordered  an invasion of the Soviet Union . In December 1941, he  declared war on the United States . By the end of 1941, German forces and the European  Axis powers  occupied most of Europe and  North Africa . These gains were gradually reversed after 1941, and in 1945 the  Allied armies  defeated the German army. On 29 April 1945, he married his longtime partner,  Eva Braun , in the  Führerbunker  in Berlin. The couple committed suicide the next day to avoid capture.\n",

[ 3 ]  Under Hitler's leadership and  racist ideology , the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of an estimated six million Jews and millions of other victims, whom he and his followers deemed  Untermenschen  ( lit.   ' subhumans ' ) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the deliberate killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European  theatre . The number of  civilians killed during World War II  was unprecedented in warfare, and the casualties constitute the  deadliest conflict in history .\n",

        "## Multi-Agent Scraper Code\n",
        "This code implements a multi-agent system designed to automate web scraping tasks dynamically based on user input. The system guides users through extracting specific data fields (e.g., names, dates) from a webpage by generating, validating, and debugging Python scraping scripts. It consists of five interconnected agents:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Page Analyzer**: Analyzes the given URL to determine if the webpage is static or dynamic and extracts its structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strategy Planner**: Selects the appropriate scraping approach (e.g., BeautifulSoup for static pages or Selenium for dynamic pages).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Code Generator**: Creates a Python script tailored to extract the requested field (e.g., proper nouns for \"names\" or patterns for \"dates\").\n",
        "\n",
        "**Validator**: Runs the generated script and checks whether it successfully extracts the desired data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Debugger**: Provides feedback to improve the code if validation fails.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system ensures the agents communicate effectively, automatically refining the generated scripts based on validation feedback. It outputs a functional scraping script and extracts the requested data fields. This setup is versatile and can be used for various web scraping tasks by specifying the URL and field type, making it highly user-friendly and adaptable for dynamic use cases."
